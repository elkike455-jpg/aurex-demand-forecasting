# Advanced Time Series Sales Prediction Using Walmart Dataset

This project focuses on predicting Walmart's weekly store sales using advanced time-series modeling techniques. The project leverages LSTM-based models (including a Bidirectional LSTM) as well as Random Forest for comparison and ensemble modeling. The primary goal is to capture complex patterns such as trends, seasonality, and other variations within the data to provide accurate and reliable sales forecasts, aiding business strategy and decision-making.

## About the Walmart Dataset

The Walmart dataset consists of weekly sales data for multiple stores, along with various factors that may influence sales. This includes promotional events, holidays, and economic indicators, offering a challenging real-world dataset for time-series forecasting tasks. By accurately capturing this data's complexities, this project aims to improve future sales predictions and support strategic business insights.

## Project Highlights

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **File**: `Notebook1-DataCleaning.ipynb`
- **Key Steps**:
  - Loaded and preprocessed the dataset.
  - Addressed missing values, outliers, and standardized sales data.
  - Extracted date-based features like month, week, and day of the week for improved temporal predictions.
- **Tools Used**: `pandas`, `numpy`

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Extracted temporal features to enrich data:
  - **Month**, **Week of Year**, and **Day of Week** features were created using the `Date` column.
- Resulting dataset was divided into train and test sets for modeling.

### 3. Model Development
